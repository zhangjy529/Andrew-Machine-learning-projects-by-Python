# Andrew-Machine-learning-projects-by-Python
Machine-learning projects from Andrew NG coursera using Python

### 1. ex1: Linear regression. 
* ex1. simple linear regression to use population of a city to predict food truck profit in that city
* ex1. Multiple linear regression to predict house price

### 2. ex2 logistic regression
* ex2. logistic regression 1: Build a logistic regression to predict whether a student will be enrolled into 
a university based on two exam scores.
* ex2. logistic regression 2: Implement regularized logistic regression to predict whether microchips 
from a fabrication plant passes quality assurance (QA).

### 3. ex3 multi-class classification
* implement one-vs-all logistic regression and neural networks to recognize hand-written digits.

### 4. ex4 neural networks
* implement the backpropagation algorithm for neural networks and apply it to the task of hand-written digit recognition. 

### 5. ex5 bias vs variance

### 6. ex6 Support vector machines
* ex6_1 SVM with linear and Gaussian kernel: use support vector machine to build a spam classifier. 
* ex6_2 SVM for email Spam Classification: We will use SVM to build a spam classifier. We will train a classifier to classify 
whether a given email x is spam (y=1) or non-spam (y=0). We need to convert each email into a feature vector x. 

### 7. ex7 k-means clustering and PCA
* ex7 Kmeans clustering: implement the K-means algorithm and use it for image compression.
* ex7_pca: Principal component analysis

### 8. ex8 Anomaly detection and recommender system
* implement the anomaly detection algorithm and apply it to detect failing servers on a network.
